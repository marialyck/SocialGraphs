[Hook]
I'm always drunk in San Francisco [X6]

[Verse 1: San Quinn]
It's a staring artist, in need of racks
You heard him too? I'll drink to that
Sittin' at the beach, drinking like a fish
Fit the privilege, arguing with my bitch
She said I need to quit, or find another groupie
Then she took the car, made me ride the munie
Bottle gone, at the bus had to hobble on
Like a real wine-o, gettin' my wobble on
End of the market, busy drunk talking to the homies
Listen tellin' Lauren diggin' in the garbage
Fuck, like I'm not a star
Lookin' for another card, free ride on the cable car
From brown to white, China Town on the hype
Patron shot after shot, no water and Sprite
Lookin' for a fight, runnin' up on tourists
Not too aware, but I'm for sure, ripped
See me on one, let me be me
You better calling SFPD

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tuf Luv]
What time is it? what day it is?
How the hell I end up it the baby crib?
I don't drink much, but when a nigga do
I get drunker than a pirate in a sailor suit
I'm on a bar with a bottle in my back pocket
Me and Paul Masson, just left crackin'
We about to go kick it with Brandy
Her and her little sister Landy
At 11:45, at my pier at 39
Had the bar at a dime, with a beer and a lime
Somebody try to draw the line I try to stop the cakes
Soon as the bottle hit my lips I'm like Frank Buttes
Drunk at the curb, askin' for my money back
Slurring words, yelling "what the look you fuckin' at"
Now everybody lookin', like ain't that a bitch
I'm at the 'Niner game, in that Raider fit
At the Giant's game, in that A's hat
When people flip me off, I just wave back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Yeah, I know the club owner, I like to rub on her
I'm in the crib with 3 shots and a cold Corona
I run laps like the 500 Daytona
Tell I find fine women, wanna know my persona
Then I'm on her like a light switch
The right bitch, that'll try to fuck a dyke bitch
I take her out to Candlestick
Get another 50cs she can handle with
That nigga B-Le, he be on that black
Cognac, Hennessy, yeah he fuck with that
I seen him at the Glass Cat
Gettin' splat at the back, it was hella racks
And, boy if you only knew
What I do, when I ride through them avenues
I'm talkin' 21, 22

I let them know what the thing do
We brought our shoes on so it cool, baby, act a fool

        [Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
It's Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look

[Verse 1]
Too $hort '85, girl that's your life smoking on that glass pipe
Had me paying attention my cousin losing weight fast
Like apartments crooked in Lakeview, Grandma stayed across the street
Playing hoop in the gym when I heard the Cougar speak
Voice deep spitting rap said he was rolling, dippin' sick
Snakeskin on top of the 'Ville and that was eighty-six
I was nine, then came eighty-nine
Then came Richie Rich and D-Loc
Oakland's 4-1-5
Groupie ass bitch tried to get a baller from the sideshow
And tried to be apart of MC Hammer's stage show
Hammer had MTV locked before Nelly and Will
I'm telling you this is real
He sold seventeen mil
Digital Underground, Money B, Fuse, and Shock
Refuel the rap world by introducing Pac
From the same spot slang rocks wrote raps on the same soil
Check the next verse I'll spit more game for you

[Chorus]
It's Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look
They juke, hit banks and rank high in the pen
Rest in peace to every one that's not here

[Verse 2]
Richie Rich got cracked early nineties with a half a thing
Heavy in that rap game still getting that dough
MC Hammer bought helicopters from the cops from the O
Probably pushing that shit (shhhh), probably keeping it low
Mac Dre put Vallejo on the map first in The Bay
You can tell me something good, if you know what to say
A Richmond cat named Filthy Phil made player hating a statement
Then he got even more famous
When he gave it to a cop trying to stop him
On some true bay thug shit, pulled his shit quick and popped him
I watched him on America's Most
I watched him put out a tape called the Manhunt and the nigga got ghost
Mac Dre still doing his thang, instead his Romper Room gang
Was robbing banks, media tried to ruin his name
Got convicted seven year in the feds
And about this time started writing them rhymes
And about this time the year was ninety one
I'm in the studio laying raps only for fun
Selling crack doing strong armed robberies at ATM's
Ninth grade high school always in the gym
My verses getting props in the bleachers
Spitting verbal heaters finna be on the shelf next season
Check the next verse I got more to say
About the real element going down in The Bay

[Chorus]
Northern California where the rappers crooks
Rappers locked down for years got they fame took
We made game made niggas put the world in fear
You better know that it's real out here

[Verse 3]
Spice One ninety-one ninety-two had the East Bay shining
Spitting about that killing that jacking and that grinding
Then came 40 'I'm tired of being stepped on'
Mr. Flamboyant, here our respect come
2Pac dropped 2Pacalypse Now, nine-one
Brenda got a baby girl my age had a son
Real shit from a real nigga who ya'll mocked
Real game from a real place it's about to be hot
Since Too Short we sold tapes out of the trunk
And we never gave parties without having funk
It was 40 and The Click, Dru Down and the Luniz
Too Short and the Dangerous Crew, here come The City
JT and the G-L-P, RBL Posse, Cougnut, Cellski, and I-M-P
X-Raided out in Sac, Brotha Lynch, and C-Bo
Totally Insane, Sean from Palo Alto
Murder capitol nineteen ninety-two
You niggas perpetrate the rhymes I rap are true
One cat on Rap-A-Lot named Sea from the East-O
The Bay was on fire recognize it my people
Had deals on the table another verse to write
Let the world know The Bay is worthy of the hype
From The Bay to Sac, I testify on this track
So we can get back on track as I spit these raps

[Chorus]
It's Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look
They juke, hit banks, rank high in the pen
Rest in peace to every one that's not here

[Verse 4]
X-Raided went to jail, for killing somebody's momma
Up in Sac, with that blood and crip drama
Forty selling thousands of records got a deal with Jive
Worth about three point five
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit in the S-F-C
C-Bo and AWOL playing with change ya'll
Trips to Atlanta, twenty deep on the plane dog
JT hooked 4 up with EMI
We sat back for a year and we seen him fly
2Pac sentenced for rape in ninety four
After being shot in skanless ass New York
Master P emerging hard up out of Richmond
Playing real tough but he's only a sixth man
Luniz really put your eyes on him
When they dissed him on the flip side of 5 on It
G-L-P signed in ninety-five along with Master P
Things about to change fast as can be
$hort gave a picnic in Fairfield
Niggas busting a thousand people trying to find a shield
Death Row and Southern Cal running the rap game
Niggas got big deals (while) we fucking off big change
C-Bo in and out of jail parole violating and such
The whole nation is biting our stuff
Farrakhan Million Man March
Half a million guns spark
2Pac released on bail Suge Knight bought him
He told us the east would hate instead of jocking our style
On radio shows, commercials knocking us down
In the city R-B-L signed a deal at the end of the nine-fifth
Then Mister C from R-B-L was shot dead
January first nineteen ninety-six
And they say The Bay isn't sick

[Chorus]
Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look
They juke, hit banks, rank high in the pen
Rest in peace to the ones that's not here

Coming straight from
Northern California where the rappers crooks
Rappers locked down for years got they fame took
We made dank, made millions put the world in fear
You got to know that it's real out here

In Northern CaliforniaGet Low Playa, San Francisco, California, home is Fillmoe
Crooked cats, our neighborhood jacks, bare facts
We back, got scratch, no scratch, broke flat
Abidin' by the rules, survivin' not to lose the game played
Hustlers stayin' paid, hit the cuts doin' raids
Snitches is viscous, talkin' bout the guidelines
Slidin' down the side sidelines being blocked by the rollers
Hold up, hold on, it's crucial in the drug zone with different mugs on
Gangstas, hustlers, playas
Must us deal with bustas causin' ruckus for the come up?
Violatin', I'm just statin', by the regulations you really should be playin'
Instead of fakin', man, that's real hatin'
Then we gettin' only the perpatratin'

[Chorus:]
I refuse to lose, I paid dues in the game
And won't nuthin' change

Takin' tricks on worldwide trips ain't my M.O
Fame came back from demos
When I first enkindled with baby boo's with new shoes
New doo's and spandex dresses
All in the Hunter's Point section of the city
Pretty momma lookin' proper
But she walkin', tennis shoes talkin'
Often cats stay scratched cuz they have no other leisure
Time but to trust in a skeezer
Not every lady, but I know a few diggers
Who dealt with niggas cuz of they figures, and stripped 'em clean
With the 17 heat to the cheek, don' t speak
Caught with a leak, drippin', lay it down
Folks is broke and playin' round
Jokin', get fooled not knowin' the rules
Everything ain't cool cuz you got a piece
Put away with ya own tool, now you deceased
Learn the rules

[Chorus]
Haters stop hatin', playas keep playin'
The hustle goes on, paper flows long
My grip's so strong I cannot let go of ghetto activities, robberies and
Mobbin' deep
Big Caddie's 93, now what you tellin' me?
Envy has you plannin' on spillin' me
Once a close comrade, blew bomb sacs together
Now it's mortal combat, you down for whatever?
Switchin' outta jealousy, smilin' but backstabbin'
Mack assassinatin' over the skills I be havin'
Conversatin' with these hoodrats, should stack your paper
Saltshaker, woof, the broad taker, wannabe gangsta
Gossipin', followin' crowds, breakin' rules, way foul
It ain't my style to be dealin' with chumps
Only deal with the real scrill, put the real raps over real funk

[Chorus][Hook]
I'm always drunk in San Francisco [X6]

[Verse 1: San Quinn]

Then she took the car, made me ride the munie
Bottle gone, at the bus had to hobble on
Like a real wine-o, gettin' my wobble on
End of the market, busy drunk talking to the homies
Listen tellin' Lauren diggin' in the garbage
Fuck, like I'm not a star
Lookin' for another card, free ride on the cable car
From brown to white, China Town on the hype
Patron shot after shot, no water and Sprite
Lookin' for a fight, runnin' up on tourists
Not too aware, but I'm for sure, ripped
See me on one, let me be me
You better calling SFPD

It's Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look
They juke, hit banks and rank high in the pen
Rest in peace to every one that's not here

[Verse 2]
Richie Rich got cracked early nineties with a half a thing
Heavy in that rap game still getting that dough
MC Hammer bought helicopters from the cops from the O
Probably pushing that shit (shhhh), probably keeping it low
Mac Dre put Vallejo on the map first in The Bay
You can tell me something good, if you know what to say
A Richmond cat named Filthy Phil made player hating a statement
Then he got even more famous
When he gave it to a cop trying to stop him
On some true bay thug shit, pulled his shit quick and popped him
I watched him on America's Most
I watched him put out a tape called the Manhunt and the nigga got ghost
Mac Dre still doing his thang, instead his Romper Room gang
Was robbing banks, media tried to ruin his name
Got convicted seven year in the feds
And about this time started writing them rhymes
And about this time the year was ninety one
I'm in the studio laying raps only for fun
Selling crack doing strong armed robberies at ATM's
Ninth grade high school always in the gym
My verses getting props in the bleachers
Spitting verbal heaters finna be on the shelf next season
Check the next verse I got more to say
About the real element going down in The Bay

[Chorus]
Northern California where the rappers crooks
Rappers locked down for years got they fame took
We made game made niggas put the world in fear
You better know that it's real out here

[Verse 3]
Spice One ninety-one ninety-two had the East Bay shining
Spitting about that killing that jacking and that grinding
Then came 40 'I'm tired of being stepped on'
Mr. Flamboyant, here our respect come
2Pac dropped 2Pacalypse Now, nine-one
Brenda got a baby girl my age had a son
Real shit from a real nigga who ya'll mocked
Real game from a real place it's about to be hot
Since Too Short we sold tapes out of the trunk
And we never gave parties without having funk
It was 40 and The Click, Dru Down and the Luniz
Too Short and the Dangerous Crew, here come The City
JT and the G-L-P, RBL Posse, Cougnut, Cellski, and I-M-P
X-Raided out in Sac, Brotha Lynch, and C-Bo
Totally Insane, Sean from Palo Alto
Murder capitol nineteen ninety-two
You niggas perpetrate the rhymes I rap are true
One cat on Rap-A-Lot named Sea from the East-O
The Bay was on fire recognize it my people
Had deals on the table another verse to write
Let the world know The Bay is worthy of the hype
From The Bay to Sac, I testify on this track
So we can get back on track as I spit these raps

[Chorus]
It's Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look
They juke, hit banks, rank high in the pen
Rest in peace to every one that's not here

[Verse 4]
X-Raided went to jail, for killing somebody's momma
Up in Sac, with that blood and crip drama
Forty selling thousands of records got a deal with Jive
Worth about three point five
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit in the S-F-C
C-Bo and AWOL playing with change ya'll
Trips to Atlanta, twenty deep on the plane dog
JT hooked 4 up with EMI
We sat back for a year and we seen him fly
2Pac sentenced for rape in ninety four
After being shot in skanless ass New York
Master P emerging hard up out of Richmond
Playing real tough but he's only a sixth man
Luniz really put your eyes on him
When they dissed him on the flip side of 5 on It
G-L-P signed in ninety-five along with Master P
Things about to change fast as can be
$hort gave a picnic in Fairfield
Niggas busting a thousand people trying to find a shield
Death Row and Southern Cal running the rap game
Niggas got big deals (while) we fucking off big change
C-Bo in and out of jail parole violating and such
The whole nation is biting our stuff
Farrakhan Million Man March
Half a million guns spark
2Pac released on bail Suge Knight bought him
He told us the east would hate instead of jocking our style
On radio shows, commercials knocking us down
In the city R-B-L signed a deal at the end of the nine-fifth
Then Mister C from R-B-L was shot dead
January first nineteen ninety-six
And they say The Bay isn't sick

[Chorus]
Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look
They juke, hit banks, rank high in the pen
Rest in peace to the ones that's not here

Coming straight from
Northern California where the rappers crooks
Rappers locked down for years got they fame took
We made dank, made millions put the world in fear
You got to know that it's real out here

In Northern CaliforniaGet Low Playa, San Francisco, California, home is Fillmoe
Crooked cats, our neighborhood jacks, bare facts
We back, got scratch, no scratch, broke flat
Abidin' by the rules, survivin' not to lose the game played
Hustlers stayin' paid, hit the cuts doin' raids
Snitches is viscous, talkin' bout the guidelines
Slidin' down the side sidelines being blocked by the rollers
Hold up, hold on, it's crucial in the drug zone with different mugs on
Gangstas, hustlers, playas
Must us deal with bustas causin' ruckus for the come up?
Violatin', I'm just statin', by the regulations you really should be playin'
Instead of fakin', man, that's real hatin'
Then we gettin' only the perpatratin'

[Chorus:]
I refuse to lose, I paid dues in the game
And won't nuthin' change

Takin' tricks on worldwide trips ain't my M.O
Fame came back from demos
When I first enkindled with baby boo's with new shoes
New doo's and spandex dresses
All in the Hunter's Point section of the city
Pretty momma lookin' proper
But she walkin', tennis shoes talkin'
Often cats stay scratched cuz they have no other leisure
Time but to trust in a skeezer
Not every lady, but I know a few diggers
Who dealt with niggas cuz of they figures, and stripped 'em clean
With the 17 heat to the cheek, don' t speak
Caught with a leak, drippin', lay it down
Folks is broke and playin' round
Jokin', get fooled not knowin' the rules
Everything ain't cool cuz you got a piece
Put away with ya own tool, now you deceased
Learn the rules

[Chorus]
Haters stop hatin', playas keep playin'
The hustle goes on, paper flows long
My grip's so strong I cannot let go of ghetto activities, robberies and
Mobbin' deep
Big Caddie's 93, now what you tellin' me?
Envy has you plannin' on spillin' me
Once a close comrade, blew bomb sacs together
Now it's mortal combat, you down for whatever?
Switchin' outta jealousy, smilin' but backstabbin'
Mack assassinatin' over the skills I be havin'
Conversatin' with these hoodrats, should stack your paper
Saltshaker, woof, the broad taker, wannabe gangsta
Gossipin', followin' crowds, breakin' rules, way foul
It ain't my style to be dealin' with chumps
Only deal with the real scrill, put the real raps over real funk

[Chorus][Hook]
I'm always drunk in San Francisco [X6]

[Verse 1: San Quinn]
It's a staring artist, in need of racks
You heard him too? I'll drink to that
Sittin' at the beach, drinking like a fish
Fit the privilege, arguing with my bitch
She said I need to quit, or find another groupie
Then she took the car, made me ride the munie
Bottle gone, at the bus had to hobble on
Like a real wine-o, gettin' my wobble on
End of the market, busy drunk talking to the homies
Listen tellin' Lauren diggin' in the garbage
Fuck, like I'm not a star
Lookin' for another card, free ride on the cable car
From brown to white, China Town on the hype
Patron shot after shot, no water and Sprite
Lookin' for a fight, runnin' up on tourists
Not too aware, but I'm for sure, ripped
See me on one, let me be me
You better calling SFPD

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tuf Luv]
What time is it? what day it is?
How the hell I end up it the baby crib?
I don't drink much, but when a nigga do
I get drunker than a pirate in a sailor suit
I'm on a bar with a bottle in my back pocket
Me and Paul Masson, just left crackin'
We about to go kick it with Brandy
Her and her little sister Landy
At 11:45, at my pier at 39
Had the bar at a dime, with a beer and a lime
Somebody try to draw the line I try to stop the cakes
Soon as the bottle hit my lips I'm like Frank Buttes
Drunk at the curb, askin' for my money back
Slurring words, yelling "what the look you fuckin' at"
Now everybody lookin', like ain't that a bitch
I'm at the 'Niner game, in that Raider fit
At the Giant's game, in that A's hat
When people flip me off, I just wave back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Yeah, I know the club owner, I like to rub on her
I'm in the crib with 3 shots and a cold Corona
I run laps like the 500 Daytona
Tell I find fine women, wanna know my persona
Then I'm on her like a light switch
The right bitch, that'll try to fuck a dyke bitch
I take her out to Candlestick
Get another 50cs she can handle with
That nigga B-Le, he be on that black
Cognac, Hennessy, yeah he fuck with that
I seen him at the Glass Cat
Gettin' splat at the back, it was hella racks
And, boy if you only knew
What I do, when I ride through them avenues
I'm talkin' 21, 22

We brought our shoes on so it cool, baby, act a fool

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
It's Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look

[Verse 1]
Too $hort '85, girl that's your life smoking on that glass pipe
Had me paying attention my cousin losing weight fast
Like apartments crooked in Lakeview, Grandma stayed across the street
Playing hoop in the gym when I heard the Cougar speak
Voice deep spitting rap said he was rolling, dippin' sick
Snakeskin on top of the 'Ville and that was eighty-six
I was nine, then came eighty-nine
Then came Richie Rich and D-Loc
Oakland's 4-1-5
Groupie ass bitch tried to get a baller from the sideshow
And tried to be apart of MC Hammer's stage show
Hammer had MTV locked before Nelly and Will
I'm telling you this is real
He sold seventeen mil
Digital Underground, Money B, Fuse, and Shock
Refuel the rap world by introducing Pac
From the same spot slang rocks wrote raps on the same soil
Check the next verse I'll spit more game for you

[Chorus]
It's Northern California cranking off the hook
Where the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look
They juke, hit banks and rank high in the pen
Rest in peace to every one that's not here

[Verse 2]
Richie Rich got cracked early nineties with a half a thing
Heavy in that rap game still getting that dough
MC Hammer bought helicopters from the cops from the O
Probably pushing that shit (shhhh), probably keeping it low

You can tell me something good, if you know what to say
A Richmond cat named Filthy Phil made player hating a statement
Then he got even more famous
When he gave it to a cop trying to stop him
On some true bay thug shit, pulled his shit quick and popped him

I watched him put out a tape called the Manhunt and the nigga got ghost
