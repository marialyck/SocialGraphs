[Intro: Vein & (Pitbull)]
(Vein!)
(Someone point me to the nearest party)
Let's have some fun
I mind my business like (whistle)
Waiting for this clock to strike (whistle)
It's a celebration
Hahaha!

[Chorus: Vein (& Pitbull)]
Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11:59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes twelve
(So I can) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(Everybody jump) jump jump jump jump jump

[Verse 1: Vein]
I'ma live it up
Today I don't give a what
Let me re-phrase that
Today I don't give a fuck
I just wanna jump jump like Imma dunk dunk
I'm bout to dribble all through here
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one like it's the new year
It's my day first time, I want all my shine
Even though I won't remember at all
I'll probably end up in a brawl
I'm going toe to toe with the wall

[Chorus: Vein (& Pitbull)]
Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11:59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes twelve
(So I can) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(Everybody) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
We shut down Times Square, extra extra read all about it
New year, it's our year, to be clear, we here
Immigrant parents but
I'm living the American dream for them now
It's it's it's about to go down
This is for Eddie, Bobby, Rudy, Johnny
Up in the sky drinking voli lodi dodi
I don't need a Maybach or Buggati
Couple of beds with some sheets, that's a party
Go DJ, head blow the speakers
All my women wear heels, no sneakers
Grim reaper, the night is mine
Meet me at 11:59

[Chorus: Vein]
Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11:59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes twelve
(So I can) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(Everybody jump) jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
I think I'll fuck the track now

[Bridge]
(Pitbull)
I want everybody to put their glasses in the air right now
And now that you got 'em up
Now let's make a toast
[Vein (Pitbull)]
Put 'em higher now, get em so much higher for me
(Now let's make a toast)
Reach for the sky right now for it's so much higher than me

[Chorus: Pitbull and Vein]
Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11:59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes twelve
(So I can) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(Everybody) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
[Intro]
This my way of letting my city know that I'd ride for 'em
I'd cry for 'em, Bust 5 for 'em, And most of all fuckin die for em...

Hey, 305...till I die (5X)

[Hook: Lil'Jon] (x2)
Nigga I ride for my motherfuckin clique
I die for my motherfuckin clique
I bust heads with my motherfuckin clique
Talk shit, watch my shit go click

[Verse 1]
Man I've been on the grind
1 in the head, 16 in the nine, I'm extra man
The game is mine in due time
It's alright I'm patient man
I know how to play my position, I know how to play my part
I know how to play these bitches, I know how to play with they hearts
I've done some dumb things, but for the most I've played it smart
Who cares if you run things? Cause I'm as live as 106 & Park
This game is nothing but a pool of blood with a bunch of sharks
Only the strong survive; It's do or die get it right
That why I roll for my peoples
Cock back, go to war for my peoples
Break bread with my peoples
Man, I'll die for my peoples
Everybody knows it's the truth
That why they respect everything that I do, everywhere that I go
Every friend, every foe, every bitch, every ho
Man I sold it all
From the weed to the X, from the X to the blow
Mark my words, I'm next to blow
P to the I, I to the T, T to the B, B To the U, Double the L
Me, Ima sell like ice cream in hell
This for my peoples that's locked up in jail
Ima succeed, I'm never gon fail
Papo just watch me

[Hook: Lil'Jon]
Nigga I ride for my motherfuckin clique
I die for my motherfuckin clique

[Verse 2]
Man I'm watchin the game closely
Uncle Luke that man did coach me
He taught me the who, what, wheres and whys
How to cross T's, How to dot I's
Little did he know he created a monster
Pitbull nigga I'm that monster
D.B. them chicos is monsters
Lil' Jon that nigga's a monster
Everybody in the clique is well equipped
Ready for Pit to take over shit
This here is not a game, this here is our lives
We can't fuck this up, we gotta get it right
If you with us and you ready for war then lets ride
Lets show how we do in the south
Kick in they door, run in their house
Since them boys think they spit fire
Fuck it, put the gun in they mouth
Follow me now, all these bitches wanna swallow me now
All these niggas that I don't even know wanna holla at me now cause they wanna be down but fuck'em man
Me, I'mma turn it up a notch
To my hustlers be careful when they murder in the blocks
To my killas be careful when you burnin up the Glocks
Last thing you wanna be is runnin from the cops
Pit's gon take it from the bottom to the top
Haters can hate but it ain't gon stop
Everybody knows I'mma blow just listen to the flow
This chico got it on lock

You know it’s history in the making
Now, mathematically this doesn’t make sense
But in this scenario, one plus one equals three
(Eeeyyyooo!)

[Chorus]
I like her and she likes her
We gon' have a love fest
One, two, tres, ménage à trois
Let's get down to business
Back it up and drop it low
Tap that like a bongo
I like them and they like me
It takes three to tango

[Verse 1]
Ladies and ladies, I am your gentleman
I open double doors 
Now go ‘head and come in
I got that Voli305 getting live
I'm in the iLov305 getting live
So many options, so little time
A little bit of Erika with extra on the side
More and more for me (Yeah)
More and more for them (Yeah)
Switch up and then (Yeah)
Switch it back again (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Two to one ratio

How bout’ we all get delirious
Sí mamita, tú y tu amiguita

[Intro: Pitbull]
Hey Gentlemen, haha
It's like these boys wanna make music for the block
You know, for they hood, for they city, haha

[Bridge: B.o.B & (Pitbull)]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(I'm tryna make music for the world)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(You feel me, right, B.o.B?)
Oh-oh
(This one we came up with)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I got up today
And my flight was late
On my way to L.A
I jumped up on a plane
And put on my shades
And threw on my headphones
I was vibin' to this beat
That made me move my feet
Boy, that thang was sticky
And then I heard this (Melody)
The dopest one I've ever seen
Something out the usual
So Mr. Pilot, please
I think I got a hit on me
Hurry to the studio (Studio)

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Well, I got up today (Today)
Put some gas in my tank (Tank)
To make it to the studio (Studio)
And then I heard this beat (Beat)
It made me move my feet (My feet)
Hell yeah, that thing was super dope
(Yeah, that thing was super dope)
And then I sang this (Melody)
The dopest one I've ever seen
Something out the usual
So Mr. Engineer
Turn up the auto-tune
So I'll be on the radio (Radio)

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Been around the world, same old songs
Now on stage after bras and thongs
Long way from what I came from
Fighting in the club for just singing a song
Now my passport's full, I'm outta pages
New places, new faces
New fans, all ages
Black, pink, purple, orange, caucasians
Latino's, European's and Asian's
In Japan, they knew all my lyrics, it was amazing
They spoke Spanish
Que ma carne, ni ma carne, asi viene el sandwich
I guess it's true what they say
Music is the universal language
Its a true blessing, you know
To travel the globe

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
[Chorus: Ke$ha]
It's goin' down, I'm yellin' timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget

Ooh-ooh (Timber), ooh-ooh (Timber)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have ‘em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs (Timber)
Face down, booty up (Timber)
That's the way we like the what (Timber)
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will (Timber)

[Bridge: Pitbull & (Ke$ha)]
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down (Oh-oh-oh)
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on planes
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumping like Lebron, now Voli
Order me another round, homie
We about to climb, why, ‘cause it's about to go down

[Bridge: Pitbull & (Ke$ha)]
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down (Oh-oh-oh)
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down
