[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)

Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)

She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
You can count ‘em, mayne
One giving head, two in the bathroom, three in the bed
It’s a twerk contest in the middle of the room
You already know I’ma fuck something soon
Now look up, bitch, suck that dick
If she ain’t paying, nigga, fuck that bitch
I ain’t tryna hate, I know it’s your career
But girl, you the finest muthafucka in here
You so fine you gotta figure
Stay with me or you could choose that nigga
What you want—coke, weed, drank?
I don’t give a fuck what a punk bitch think
Shut up, bitch, fuck up, bitch
Talk that shit, get fucked up, bitch
You the one sucking dick at the hotel
Cheating on your man but I won’t tell

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)

Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches in my hotel room
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
If my old bitch is your new bitch
And I’m there, she gotta suck two dicks
‘Cause the bitch gon’ do what I tell her to
And pay these hoes is what I never do
Who you lying on, bitch?
You not the main one, you a side hoe, bitch
Why you all on my dick?
Now you understand why I’m calling you a bitch
You got no job, you can’t afford that shit
All up in the club and you’re way too lit
What you gon’ do, keep swiping them cards?
Buy me new shit, make my dick get hard?
You know you look good from your head to your shoes
Staring in my face like, “Player, what it do?”
It’s the way you move, baby, I’m lovin’ you
The afterparty’s in my suite at The W

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (ten)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches in my hotel room
I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches in my hotel room
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down

[Verse 4: Too $hort & Jazze Pha]
When I was 16 used to fuck hoodrats, it's not a big thing
A few years later did some major upgrading
See a top-notch, I say "Hey, what's up baby"
(16 Hoes) Can't find your lost whore?
She's probably with $hort, playin' at the golf course
Another ego, a hole-in-one
The game ain't boring, my hoes are fun
I got (16 Hoes) all nicknamed Bitch
Make Daddy happy, y'all get that dick
Since they're everywhere, you figure I'll stop
Couldn't be a better player than me
Nigga, I got (16 Hoes)

Wilt Chamberlain, ho

[Verse 1]
I met your momma, at  a pool party
All the nasty little things she would do for me
If I told you, you probably wouldn't feel me though
But your momma was in the "Cocktales" video
More hoes than your favorite MC
If you find a motherfucker that's hatin' on me
It's about some pussy
'Cause I won't stop pimpin'
Real player with a whole lot of women
Lil sis just left with me
Ex-girlfriends is my specialty
She do doin' things you would never believe
I fucked her so good will she ever leave?
$hort Dog, I'm a rock star
Two bitches in the bed, and I'm rock hard
When TMZ had me runnin' from the cop car
I had four naked bitches at the spot, boy

19,999 bitches (Bitches)
I fucked 19,999 (Bitches)

[Verse 2]
You say I'm lyin', I say you hatin'
It's a fact, there's no debatin'
The shit happened, it's done
If you don't know your daddy
Then you might be my son
Your momma been to All-Star Weekend
Super Bowl Sunday, a fight or the Freaknik?
Spring break, Girls Gone Wild
Ask Maury, are you my child? (Are you my child?)
No, I'm not the father
Yeah, I fucked her, but never caught her
20 years later, I did it to her daughter
Fucked her in the car that you bought her
You couldn't be a better player than me
Not even if you fucked everyday of the week
I know you think you got it like that, repeat
Wilt Chamberlain, ain't got shit on me, bitch

[Hook]
19,999 bitches (Bitches)

[Verse 3]
Remember when you seen me out in Detroit?
You were Reedy and a whole bunch of D boys
Surrounded by all that pearl
I know one of them hoes had to be your girl
At the derby in Kentucky
I had rich white women wantin' to fuck me
And I party hard on Mardi Gras
Ten bitches every night, I did it all
I did Ashleys, Keishas, Ericas
And it them was only hoes in America (In America)
I had more in London, a few in France
I didn't want to leave when I flew to Japan
I got bitches for all ethnicities
Still callin', sayin' how they're missin' me
But they know, ain't no change in him
AKA Wilt Chamberlain

[Hook]
Pimp niggas don't pay a dime ppppppppppppooooooooooooooooopppppppppppppp
I'm fucking two bitches at the same time
Then I hit the studio and I write a rhyme
I call it "Tramp Hoes Ain't Hard to Find"

[Verse 1]
I took two bitches to a hotel
I told em both "you know I won't tell"
Bitch, curiosity killed the cat
You gotta lick the clit while I hit it from the back
Don't be stingy girl, lick my balls too
You was talkin big shit when I called you
You said you never fucked another girl before
And you wanted me to help you so
Bitch, I took you down to the strip club
I told you "look around, who you wanna fuck?"
You picked thick chocolate, big booty, big tits
I told her she could have you, and this dick
She got so excited she got off work early
Jumped in the back and started lickin on my girlie
I couldn't get home fast enough
Now it's time to fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When we got to my room she started actin nervous
Sat down and said "lets order room service"
I said "bitch, what are ya smokin?
A big fat dick coming from East Oakland"
I stuck it in her mouth, she started moanin
I said "hang up, get off my telephone, bitch"
I put the game down immediately
I'm a vet from the town, started freaking them freaks
And once they started, they couldn't stop
I fuck 'em for awhile then I kick back and watch
Two bitches at the same time
And neither one of these hoes is mine
I don't give a fuck, I'm a player
I been doin this for years, I got bitches everywhere
You think I'm paying hoes? You got the game distorted
You a trick, mad cause you can't afford it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Them bitches kissed twenty minutes straight non-stop
Strip girl on the bottom, 'lil momma on top
It was beautiful, you know what happened next
Spent twenty more minutes licking each other's breasts
Two titty sucking hoes, navels and toes
Bitch rolled her on her stomach, licked her asshole
I was smokin on a fat one, layin in the cut
After seeing this shit, I ain't wanna fuck
I wanna see how long they can keep goin
I don't know, I fell asleep on 'em
When I woke up I was getting my dick sucked
These hoes horny as fuck, they can't get enough
I was fucking them sluts 'til the sun came up
Nut in both their mouths, you ever done that stuff?
Dog baby, this shit ain't really nuthin to me
You better handcuff your ho or I'll be fucking your freak, nigga

[Hook]

Sing it, pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fuckin two bitches at the same time
Fucking two bitches at the same time
Let 'em know pimp niggas don't pay a dime, bitch
Hit the studio and write a rhyme
These tramps ain't hard to find nigga
Bitch
Two Bitches
Two of 'em
2 delicious Bitches
[P. Diddy]
Yo $hort man, I was with this trick the other night
She was like, "Hey Diddy - um, Diddy - why are you so motherfuckin fly?"
I had to tell the bitch I'm just about that paper beotch

Everything I do is a world premier
I know you're not tryin to front, girl come here
I get up early in the mornin, work late at night
So when you talk about me you better say it right
I get my pimp on, whatever I get on
Pop rock rap R&B it's a hit song
I keep it movin no matter what your age
Bitches screamin out Puff Daddy's on stage
Drinkin 'gnac, cashin checks
When I'm not makin money I'm havin sex
International, superstar
People wanna know just who you are
I'm the Lear jet ridin, mansion residin
If I throw a party you'll be dancin all night and
Let's have some fun girl, it's okay
I work hard, now it's time to play

[Hook: singer]
If it's 'bout that money
If it's about that bullshit
If you got that paper, we can roll
No time for haters, gotta go
When it's 'bout that mo-ney
Gotta keep it comin
Niggas hate us all day long
Cause we get our paper on and oh-nnnnn

[$hort] That's right, $hort Dawg in the house
[Diddy] Yeah
[$hort] P. Diddy in the house
[Diddy] P, yeah

Too $hort, Too $hort, gotta make that money
Two-thousand watts, two-thousand watts
Gotta make that money, Bad Boy, Bad Boy
Gotta cash that money; gotta make that money money
Gotta take, gotta make, gotta cash that money money

[Diddy] And we out
"Nigga this pimp shit!"
