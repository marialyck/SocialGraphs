You civilians movin' fast, I can slow you down
Enough syrup on my crown to slow your town down
I spilled purple on the ground, I grew pur-purple mountain
Purple panthers in my house, syrup water fountain (that codeine)
Don't gamble with the dealer, I'ma pharmacist
Purple rain on my diamonds, a-aquaberry fist
My rubby wrist glist when I wood wheel twist
I done got a mix formula with the quiet kiss
Aww shit look who it is, The Codeine Scientist
It's double cup, finna run 'em up

Yeah, you boys think you got somethin' in town
Shit, wait 'til I come around, I'ma slow your whole city down

Pourin' purple stuff all over your city

Double cup

Fast wine slow wine (we behaving bad) (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Yo! When I was young and my dad had a reefer house
I'd catch a contact and talk like Eek-A-Mouse
Go to school act like I'm pulling reefer out
Kinda funny 'cause I used to freak my teachers out
Like "dong dong diddy dong dong", seen?
So much mi go teach ya 'bout
Peace to the one Black Chiney and the heaters out
In the club, everybody on Sinatra
Look around, everybody on Sinatra
I ain't talking 'bout this shit they call Coke and vodka
I'm talking 'bout the shit you snort and go "ha ha ha ha ha ha ha"
I mean just go bonkers
Make the young girls wild, and then go topless
Make the dope boys smile they don't need binoculars
Make a nigga wanna pull out choppas
Brrap, brrap, brrap they got ya

[Hook]
Ring, bom bom bom bom
Aerosol can, bom bom bom bom
Monkey outside, bom bom bom bom
Shooting all night, bom bom bom bom (gotta make it to the end)
Bom to the bom to the clang clang clang
Banging on that ass like orangutan (Jesus)
Motherfucker transform to a grown man
And transform again like
(We behaving bad)

[Verse 2]
Skateboard, can a nigga make more?
Steal my style? I ain't got no reward
Like hmm, make yourself bigger like mushroom
Mario Kart
All y'all niggas wanna get like me
All y'all niggas wanna spit like P
Missin' ass niggas wanna hit like me
Meanwhile yo bitches wanna kiss my D
Child Rebel Soldier hit that ass for the combo
AK-47 and the dress on a rhino boom
Commodore like Lionel zoom
Hauling that ass like a new Veyron
Am I wrong?
Riding with my bitch mane all night long
One second I'm here next second I'm gone
That's two in 60 seconds nigga what you want?
Girls on me like they superglued on
My dick like a table you can place food on
Make Szechuan, or Hunan
Nigga I'm hot like the place Mulan

[Chorus]
Ring, bom bom bom bom
Aerosol can, bom bom bom bom
Monkey outside, bom bom bom bom
Shooting all night, bom bom bom bom
Bom to the bom to the clang clang clang
Banging on that ass like orangutan
Motherfucker transform to a grown man
And transform again like
(We behaving bad)

[Verse 3]
Nigga, I'm hot like the place Tucson
BBC ICECREAM skewed on
No discounts, no coupons
But I got the Rolls Royce for the Grey Poupon
Now you jealous with your face screwed on
Who on? Nigga, you on?
Feeble ass niggas only get booed on
Shitty attitude get pissed and pooed on
Fucking with P? Shh, you wrong
Retreat nigga, you don't wanna feud on
Your nerves ain't there for a big dude on
Stompin' that ass until you gone
Hoping that you make it home wit' yo shoes on
While I'm tourin' these booties, scoring these movies
I know that I make it when I'm chilling with Stewie
Ask Marc Jacobs what I did for Louis
Sunglasses campaign and jewelry
Ask Alber how he really wanna use me
Comme Des Garçons I ain't usin' that loosely
Look at your forehead sweating profusely

[Chorus]
Ring, bom bom bom bom
Aerosol can, bom bom bom bom
Monkey outside, bom bom bom bom
Shooting all night, bom bom bom bom
Bom to the bom to the clang clang clang
Banging on that ass like orangutan
Motherfucker transform to a grown man
And transform again like
(We behaving bad)

[Outro]
Fast wine slow wine, we behaving bad
Fast wine slow wine, we behaving bad
Fast wine slow wine, we behaving bad
Fast wine slow wine, we behaving bad
Fast wine slow wine, we behaving bad
Fast wine slow wine, we behaving bad
Fast wine slow wine, we behaving bad
Fast wine slow wine, we be, we behaving bad
